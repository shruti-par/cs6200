The focused BFS resulted in a 1000 urls containing the one or more of the keywords entered by the user.
This search tended to be restricted to the entered keywords and thus closer to the seed url. But, as the depth increased the topic started
diverging away from the seed url.

To handle keyword variations -
  I first converted both the keywords and the url to lowercase. I also replaced any spaces between the phrases with underscores so as to
  increase the probablity of finding them in urls.
  
I considered the following variations - 
  Martian|Rover|Orbit|Pathfinder|Mars Mission|Mars Exploration|Red Planet
