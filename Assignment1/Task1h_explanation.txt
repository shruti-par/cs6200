Web crawling using two techniques - 
    Breadth first search
    Depth first search
   
On comparing the output of the two techniques, it can be observed that there is an overlap of 14 links. This is not a huge overlap
considering that we are looking at 1000 urls.

Coverage of topic and efficiency of searches - 
    The BFS appears to efficiently crawl the web and access urls related to the seed url. The search is related to the topic but not in
    depth of the topic. Thus, it is a broad search of the topic.
    
    THe DFS appears to crawl the web and access in depth urls starting from the seed url. The urls start diverging from the main topic as
    the depth of the search increases. Thus, this search reaches deeper into the topic.
